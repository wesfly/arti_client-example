# ```arti_client``` example

This repo demonstrates how to get the content of a hidden service via tor.

More examples are available [here](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/tree/main/crates/arti-client/examples).

If you figure out how to use it with HTTPS, please make pull request (me stoopidðŸ˜…)

NOTE: arti_client is not yet stable. Bear this in mind when using it in a production environment. Also, because it is in the early stages of development, the API will probably change significantly in the future.
